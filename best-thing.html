        <h2>Slipping Away</h2>
        <p class="justify-text">"Saylor! Saylor! Oh my god" is all I hear as everything around me becomes hazy. I feel the weight of my body pull me down until I hit the cold tile.<br><br>
            I don't remember much, but something that stands out is feeling cold. Like I was floating in an ice bath, I could barely hear anything around me. All the voices are mumbled and then darkness envelopes me.<br><br>
            I wake up to a beeping noise, my vision is blurry and my throat feels like sand paper. I blink a few times until my vision starts to clear, and I see that I'm at the hospital. I look down and see the bandages on my forearm and the different cords that are all connected to me.<br><br>
            I try to sit up, but my head feels like it weighs a thousand pounds and I almost puke. I hear voices outside the door, and I try to call out for help. Nothing comes out, my voice is raspy like I haven't spoken in days. I try to clear my throat, but it only makes it worse.<br><br>
            Finally I see my mom's brown hair appear in the door way and when she sees me her eyes widen in surprise. She rushes to my bed side "Saylor, you're awake" I stare into her tear stained eyes and see the pain hidden behind them.<br><br>
            "Mom" is all I manage to get out as she cradles my face with her hands. A moment later my father walks in with a doctor.<br><br>
            "Saylor" is all he says as he takes a seat next to my mom. The doctor stands at the edge of the hospital bed and jots a few things down on his clipboard.<br><br>
            He clears his throat "Saylor, I'm so happy you're awake. How do you feel?" His voice is calm.<br><br>
            "My throat is dry and my head is killing me" it comes out like a whisper and he nods.<br><br>
            "I'll get you something for both, do you know why you're here?" My mom squeezes my arm.<br><br>
            I nod as I stare down at my arms "I tried.... I hurt.... I cut myself" I finally get it out half out of breath.<br><br>
            "You did, and because of that we have you under observation to make sure you won't do it again. Unfortunately when the incident happened, you fell and hit your head pretty hard on the floor. You've been in a coma for a week" my heart drops.<br><br>
            "It's okay honey" my mom whispers in my ear and squeezes my hand.<br><br>
            "Oh" is all I manage to say, because what the hell do you say to that?<br><br>
            "I'll get you some medicine and let you rest. I'll speak with your parents outside" he nods and they both stand then follow him out.<br><br>
            My mom shuts the door behind her as I stare ahead at the wall and think; it didn't work. I wasn't supposed to be here or anywhere really. The only thing I thought I could accomplish and Failed. I gently run my fingers over the bandages and memories flash through me.<br><br>
            I remember having a panic attack in my room. I crawled into fetal position next to my bed and cried until I felt like my throat was closing in. The room started to spin and I just wanted it all to stop, for once. I wanted the voice in my head to stop berating me. I wanted the pain I felt deep down to stop hurting so fucking much.<br><br>
            Yet here I am, alive and some what okay. I don't know how to feel or how to truly face the consequences of what I've done. Will my parents forgive me? Can I forgive myself? Can I continue on with my life like nothing happened? I have so many questions and zero answers.<br><br>
            Right now, I don't regret it but I'm pissed that it didn't work like I planned. I let out a long, deep sigh and tears start to flood the corner of my eyes. I try to hold them back, because I've already cried so much and I promised myself I wouldn't do it again.<br><br>
            I quickly wipe my eyes but the tears keep coming. My heart starts to race, so I grab the extra pillow and hold it to my chest. I try to steady my breathing but nothing helps and I feel like the walls are beginning to close in. Just then then the door opens and my parents along with the doctor come back inside.<br><br>
            The second they see me my mom rushes over and holds me tight "It's okay Say, just breathe... everything is okay" my dad stands next to her with a stoic expression as usual. God forbid is daughter cause any embarrassment to him and his family.<br><br>
            A nurse walks in and injects what I assume is pain medicine into my IV. Less than a minute later I start to feel light and things get a little hazy; the medicine is working. My heart rate slows down as the panic in me slowly disappears.<br><br>
            "We'll have to keep her here for a couple more days to monitor her. After that if everything checks out we'll discharge her, but she will have to see a Psychiatrist weekly" my parents agree and the doctor exits.<br><br>
            I hear my dad sigh "Why Saylor? Why did you do this?" He sounds angry as he takes a seat by the window and stares out.<br><br>
            "Arthur something must have brought her to this point" my mom says softly and he laughs.<br><br>
            "Weakness, that's what happened. She let's everything get to her and then she freaks out and does something stupid for attention Jen, this isn't the first time and it won't be the last" he runs a hand down his face as my eyes start to close.<br><br>
            My mom rubs my arm, completely ignoring him and I remain quiet. He knows exactly why I did this, even if he wants to act oblivious. I told him, I told them both the night it happened and they told me to keep it to myself. To 'get over it' and not 'to act so desperate'. I went to them for help, and they silenced me... no wonder why I'm here.<br><br>
            My dad reads a newspaper, like we're not sitting in a hospital room because I tried to kill my self. I stare at him and notice how green his eyes are, just like mine and his dark hair which is now speckled with grays. I look a lot like him and always have, but beyond our physical appearance we have nothing else in common.<br><br>
            He's a District Attorney, the best in Connecticut. He's known for his cold, stoic behavior and ruthless ways in the courtroom. What no one realizes is he is also like that at home. He's always so closed off and cold, emotionless to say the least. I don't think he's ever told me he loved me or my mom.<br><br>
            My mom is a lot more warm and caring. She's a fashion designer and owns multiple boutiques all over Connecticut, New York, Los Angeles and Paris. She's a business woman and has always put in more effort than my father; selfishly I wish she tried harder.<br><br>
            I tried to be close with my mom and dad. I used to do anything good or bad to get their attention. Even if it was only for a moment. I've always wondered how they ended up together when they're polar opposites, but people do say that opposites attract.<br><br>
            I'm an only child and at times it gets lonely, especially when both of them are traveling for work. I spent my elementary, middle school and early high school years at boarding school. Junior year I asked to spend it closer to home and I fought tooth and nail; eventually they agreed.<br><br>
            I cam home and was enrolled at Greensward Prep, a private school near our house. I was nervous to say the least, but held my head high. I made friends and even joined the cheerleading team. Things were going so much better than expected, until that night.<br><br>
            "Saylor get some rest okay? We'll come back tomorrow" my mom kisses my forehead as she follows my dad out into the hallway.<br><br>
            Once the door clicks shut, I close my eyes and hear their attempt at whispering "The doctor said she lost the baby okay? It's a done" my dad's voice is firm.<br><br>
            Baby? What baby? Then the realization hits me... oh my god I was pregnant. My bottom lip quivers as I grab a pillow to muffle my cries. My entire body shakes as I scream into the pillow. I didn't know I was pregnant but if I did would it have changed anything?<br><br>
            I hear their foot steps fade away and eventually I'm able to calm myself. At this point I feel completely numb from everything thats happened. I look down at my wrists and wish I would have gone deeper, because it would have hurt a hell of a lot less than how I'm feeling right now.<br><br>
            My chest tightened and heart ached for the possibility of a life I could have had and given my unborn child. Then I laugh, a loud ridiculous laugh that makes me feel like I'm going insane. I'm seventeen how the hell could I have raised a child? Like my parents would have ever allowed that.<br><br>
            I roll over onto my side and memories flood through me from that night and how I wish I could have stopped him. If I was stronger or louder then maybe he would have stopped. I feel nauseous and throw up on the side of my bed, because I'm too weak to stand up.<br><br>
            I buzz for a nurse who comes in and cleans it up. She has a sympathetic look on her face and pats my arm before walking out. I wipe my mouth and drink down some water. But nothing helps the ache in the pit of my stomach.<br><br>
            I need to get the hell out of here, out of this hospital and town. I have one year left of school and if I can push through it or finish early then I can leave and never look back. I bet my parents will be happy to be rid of me, mainly my dad. He always wished he had a son and I've been nothing but a disappointment since I could talk.<br><br>
            I may not be sure of a lot, but what I do know is I want to do better and be better. I refuse to let what happened define me even though sometimes that feels impossible. I lay back onto the bed and close my eyes and dream about a new life for myself.<br><br>
