                <p>Blake Hallows has faced more trauma in her twenty two years than most people face their entire life. From losing her mom to cancer, to her high school sweetheart their second year of college in a terrible accident. Death has basically become numbing to her. But, with only 
                    a couple years left of college she has come to realize that she missed out on a lot. So, she makes a pact with herself to finally step out of her comfort zone and enjoy the time she has left.<br><br>
                    Ryder Alexander transfers over to UCSD his senior year which is highly unusual. He was offered the position as a starting quarterback because it’s number two in state and reluctantly accepted. The Aztecs lost their quarterback a couple years prior and have been using 
                    their backup but the team hasn’t been doing well. So Ryder is brought in to try and make a difference. What he doesn’t expect is to meet a blonde beauty who completely sweeps him off of his feet.<br><br>
                    Can Blake move on from her tragic past and open up her heart again to someone who might just be worthy of it? Or will the demons from her past come back to haunt them both.<br><br></p>
