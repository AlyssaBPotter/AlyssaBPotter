        <h2>I'm Sorry</h2>
            <p class="center-text">Feyre<br><br><u>Prologue</u><br></p>
        <p class="justify-text">
            Did you ever make a plan for yourself, a path so to say and then somewhere along the way you come to a fork in the road and veer off course? Well that's exactly what happened to me. I imagined myself finish college at Harvard and majoring in Business, so I could get some kick ass marketing degree in a sports field; preferably hockey. I worked so hard until my vision became blurred and then one day I decided to change everything with one very stupid decision.<br><br></p>     
            <p class="center-text">~<br><br></p>
            <p class="justify-text">"Mom...?" My voice is shaky and course from crying myself to sleep. <br><br>
            I hear her suck in a breath "Feyre? Feyre is that you?" the panic in her tone nearly kills me.<br><br>
            "Ye...yes it's me. I'm sorry mom, for everything" I say through a choked breath.<br><br>
            "Sweetheart you don't need to apologize. Where are you?" she asks more calmly.<br><br>
            "I'm on about to get on a bus that will drop me off right outside of Ridgewater. Can you pick me up? I know it's a lot to ask but..." she cuts me off.<br><br>
            "What time? I'll be there" I exhale slowly.<br><br>
            "8pm" I hear her say something and I assume she's talking to me step dad, Cassian.<br><br>
            "We'll be there Fey, I can't wait to see you. I love you" she says with zero judgment and I almost break down again but I refrain since I'm at a bus station.<br><br>
            "I love you to mom, thank you so much" after that we hang up. I look down at Harlow asleep in my arms as tears stream down my cheeks. I should have told her about her, but I couldn't. It was too much to say over the phone so she'll just have to see when she picks us up.<br><br>
            The announcer over the speaker calls out, I adjust Harlow in my arms and roll my bag behind me as we step through the doors. I find us a nice seat in the back and slide the luggage underneath the seat in front of me. It's not much, just a few articles of clothing and most of Harlow's things plus the diaper bag I have slung over my arm with diapers, sippy cups, snacks, etc. I sit down and place the diaper bag between my feet on the floor. I stare out the window at the gloomy town and release a shaky breath because we're almost home; finally. <br><br>
            I never imagined my life turning out this way, running off with a boy I swore I was going to marry at twenty one and getting pregnant shortly afterwards. I was shocked when I saw the results of five different tests in front of me that all said positive. I kept thinking to myself, this can't be true I was on birth control and we were so careful but after the doctor confirmed it I knew I had a decision to make. I told Shane and at first he was thrilled so obviously we decided to keep her but farther along in the pregnancy when I had to be on bed rest or was super sick he regretted the decision altogether.<br><br>
             I'll never forget the day when I was slumped over the toilet with a swollen bell, puking my brains out. He stood in the bathroom door and watched without a care in the world. He laughed and made the remark that it was punishment for being selfish and wanting to keep it. I should have known then that he was clearly not the one. But it took a lot longer for my eye to open and see the true reality of the situation. I was working full time at a diner in downtown area of Virginia Beach while he was working on music with his band.<br><br>
            I worked up until I gave birth even though the doctor was highly against it and put me on bed rest. Looking back and on it all, I wish I would have seen the red flags that were so apparent but I was blinded by love or what I thought was love. I hate that it took him hitting me one time for me to finally smarten up and get the hell out of dodge. Even though he didn't hit me before, the emotional and mental abuse was enough to leave deep scars. <br><br>
            Harlow wakes up and I end up taking her to the bathroom at the back of the bus. We've been working on potty training since she was one and started walking. She's been doing really well with it but I still keep her in pull ups. I wipe off the toilet seat and lay down a cover, then set her on it and she goes. I clean her off and then it's my turn and she washes her little hands in the sink. I stare at her and my heart swells, such an innocent soul with no idea how much better life could have been if I would have taken off the second I knew I was pregnant. <br><br>
            She loved her dad so much even though he wanted nothing to do with her. I made sure to shower her in unconditional love and give her everything I could even if that meant sometimes I went hungry or couldn't get tampons or whatever because she wanted a toy. I've made sure to put her above everything else in my life and use her as motivation to do better. I've been teaching her how to read and she absolutely loves it. Her vocabulary is advanced for a two year old and it gives me hope that she's going to be a little smarty pants. <br><br>
            Once I wash my hands we go back out to our seat and I set her in the one next to me, with a cup of juice and some snacks. I give her my phone to watch Youtube on, thankfully I paid my phone bill for the months so I have that much going . She's always been such a sweet, loving and calm child. I have no idea how I got so lucky with her, sleeping was rocky but around six months I was able to get her on a good schedule and I've been strict with it. Lately things have been rocky but we're managing. <br><br>
            I try to stay awake now that she's up, but it's hard because I keep dozing off. Eventually after days and hours on hours of bus rides, we finally pull into our final stop. The lights on the bus turn on and I stand, taking the moment to stretch. I unbuckle Harlow and she stands, doing her own little stretch. I set her on the seat and have her climb onto my back so I can carry the diaper bag and hold onto our luggage. I stand in the isle and wait in line, as people start to walk off of the bus. <br><br>
            When we get outside the fresh, cool winter air hits me and my body gets the chills. It's the beginning of December so the first snow has already hit by now. There's patches of snow everywhere and I even spot ice, I look around to see if I can spot my mom or Cassian. I take a few steps and almost lose my balance slipping but strong arms catch me "Feyre?" I look and see Grayson my younger brother, who doesn't look so young anymore.<br><br>
            "Gray" I say and he grins as he wraps his arms around me not seeing Harlow on my back.<br><br>
            He pulls back quickly when he feels her "What the..? Who's this?" he asks and stares at me in confusion.<br><br>
            Right as I'm about to speak my mom and Cassian rush over "Feyre!" my mom calls out as I set Harlow down and dive into her arms.<br><br>
            Tears stream down both of our cheeks as she holds onto me "Mom... I've missed you so much" I say as we pull apart and I wipe my eyes.<br><br>
            I immediately hug Cassian who is also teary eyes "God Feyre, it's so good to have you back" he says and squeezes me.<br><br>
            I feel Harlow tug on my jacket "Mama?" she asks and everyone looks at her and then back to me. <br><br>
            I reach down to pick her up and she hooks herself around me. I flash them all a nervous smile "So this is my daughter Harlow" I say and my mom just stares at me with wide eyes "Harlow this is your Grandma Saylor, Grandpa Cass, and Uncle Grayson. Remember all the pictures and videos I showed you?" she shyly nods.<br><br>
            "You have a daughter" my mom says with  a gasp and covers her mouth.<br><br>
            "Surprise" I say awkwardly.<br><br>
            "She's beautiful, just like you" my mom says in response and takes a step towards us, Harlow gets nervous and hides her head in my shoulder.<br><br>
            "It's okay Harlow, she's my mom... like I'm yours" she pulls her little head back and looks at me.<br><br>
            "She's your mama?" I nod as she turns her head and inspects my mom who eagerly wants to hold her.<br><br>
            "Hi Harlow, it's so nice to meet you" she smiles her toothy little grin.<br><br>
            "Gandma" she says and my mom swoons.<br><br>
            "Yes baby girl, you can call me grandma" she holds her arms out and my mom happily takes her, pulling her into her chest and hugging her.<br><br>
            Harlow is instantly comfortable and my heart melts "This is your grandpa" my mom says and Cassian waves to her, the whole interaction is the cutest thing. <br><br>
            Grayson also talks to her and I notice her little flushed cheeks and giggles. Cassian takes my luggage and we hurry to the car before it starts to snow again. I sit in the back and we put her in the middle, I feel bad not giving them a heads up because there isn't a carseat but my mom says we'll get one asap. The drive back to the house is full of music and reminiscing on old times that make me both happy and sad. After everything I've put them through and they still show up for me after two years, just goes to show how truly lucky I am to have them as a family. <br><br>
            We pull into the driveway of the house I grew up in and tears swell in the corner of my eyes. I wipe them away so Harlow doesn't see me cry. We all get out and I carry her up to the front door, Cassian has my bag as we head inside and the familiar smell and warmth are overwhelming to my senses. I set her down and she looks around with wide eyes "Oh my gosh mama, this is so bigs" she says and I smile.<br><br>
            I bend down to her level "This is the house that I grew up in sweetie, it's our home now for a little while" I say and pull her small coat off.<br><br>
            My mom rests her hand on my shoulder "It's your home for as long as you need Feyre, don't rush to find your own. We love having both of you here" I immediately wrap my arms around her.<br><br>
            "Thank you mom, thank you so much" she tightens her squeeze and then we pull apart. <br><br>
            "Once you settle let's make a list of the things we need to get for her" my mom says cheerfully.<br><br>
            "Yes, thank you. We should start by showering because we've been traveling by bus for a few days now" I see the sadness in her eyes. <br><br>
            "Fey, we could have flown you two out here" she says.<br><br>
            "It all happened so fast mom, I just needed to get away" I say and hope she understands.<br><br>
            She gives me a reassuring nod "I get it, when you're ready if you ever... I hope you know you can talk to me about whatever happened."<br><br>
            I squeeze her hand lightly "Thank you" Grayson takes our bags upstairs to my room and I let Harlow run after him. It makes me happy that she's already warmed up to him and my parents, as the thought crosses my mind I immediately think of my dad and how I need to call him.<br><br>
            I rush upstairs after them and step into my room. I take a moment to let all of my emotions settle before taking Harlow into the bathroom and running us a warm bath. I find bubbles under the sink and pour some of the bottle in and then I undress her and myself. I dip my toes in to check the temperature and then I take a seat and scoop her small frame into my arms and rest her between my legs. I remembered to grab a couple of her favorite bath toys before we left so I reach over for them and had them to her. <br><br>
            She starts singing some random songs and plays as I watch her hair and then her body. I soak myself in and then let out some of the water and stand, turning the shower head on for a moment so I can clean myself off. Once I'm finished I step out and drain a little more water so she has just enough to play with and I dry off with a towel. I sit on the toilet and brush my hair, watching her play until it's time to dry her off.<br><br>
            Later in the evening, after eating dinner and unpacking our bag; we're exhausted. We head upstairs to get some rest. She snuggles up next to me and I hold her close like I do every night. I read her a bedtime story and then lay back once she's asleep and close my tired eyes. I hope things work out for us and that this turns out to be the best decision I could have made. All I want is to be the best mom I can be, and to give her the life she deserves.<br><br>
